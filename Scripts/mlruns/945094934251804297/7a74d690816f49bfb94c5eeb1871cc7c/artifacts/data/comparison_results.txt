Statistical significance: 0.02 
We will test statistical difference between mean accuracy for: 
1) Group of models with tree__pruning == False 
1) Group of models with tree__pruning == True 
We have significant evidence that Group 1 does not follow a normal distribution. (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)
We have significant evidence that Group 2 does not follow a normal distribution. (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)
We can accept the null hypothesis that  Groups 1 and 2 do not follow the same distribution. (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)
Let's test now the statistical differences between mean accuracies of groups.Our alteranative hypothesis will be that the mean accuracy for group A is lower than mean accuracy for group B.
We will perform a Wilcoxon Test as samples don't follow normal distribution.
We can accept the null hypothesis that mean accuracies for both groups are equal.
