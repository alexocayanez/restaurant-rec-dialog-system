Statistical significance: 0.05 
We will test statistical difference between mean accuracy for: 
1) Group of models with tree__pruning == False 
1) Group of models with tree__pruning == True 
We have significant evidence that mean acuracy for Group 1 does not follow a normal distribution. (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)
We have significant evidence that mean acuracy for Group 2 does not follow a normal distribution. (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)
We have significant evidence that Groups 1 and 2 do not follow the same distribution. (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)

Let's test now the statistical differences between mean accuracies of groups.
Our alteranative hypothesis will be that the mean accuracy for group A is lower than mean accuracy for group B.
We will perform a Wilcoxon Test as samples don't follow normal distribution.
We have significant evidence that mean accuracy for Group 1 is {alternative_tag} than mean accuracy for Group 2.
