Statistical significance: 0.01 
We will test statistical difference between mean accuracy for: 
1) Group of models with lr__regularization == False 
1) Group of models with lr__regularization == True 
We have significant evidence that mean acuracy for Group 1 does not follow a normal distribution. (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)
We have significant evidence that mean acuracy for Group 2 does not follow a normal distribution. (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)
We can accept the null hypothesis that mean acuracy for Groups 1 and 2 follow the same distribution. (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)

Let's test now the statistical differences between mean accuracies of groups.
Our alteranative hypothesis will be that the mean accuracy for group 1 is greater than mean accuracy for group 2.
We will perform a Wilcoxon Test as samples don't follow normal distribution.
We can accept the null hypothesis that mean accuracies for both groups are equal.
